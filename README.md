# PyOSC

Python library to support OSC (Open Sound Control).

## About the Project

I had issues getting the support I needed out of any of the other packages, so I decide how hard can it be...

## Features
- Support for both UDP and TCP transport protocols
- Flexible message handling with customizable handlers
- Support for both OSC version 1.0 and 1.1
- Background processing of incoming messages to avoid blocking the main thread
- Simple API for sending OSC messages to remote hosts
